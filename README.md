The compiled sources for Chosen library (https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen). 

Since Chosen has no compiled sources in its original repository, it can be cumbersome to install it via Bower package manager. This repository tries to make things easier by hosting the compiled jQuery and Prototype plugins.

For documentation, usage, and examples, see: http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
